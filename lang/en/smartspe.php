To organise student in groups, the file format should include:

* Team # - the group name students will be added to
* Student ID - the student number
* Surname - the student’s last name
* Title - the student’s title (e.g., Mr, Ms, Dr)
* Given Names - the student’s first name

If a Student ID is not available, the plugin will try to match students by both first and last name. It first searches within the current course’s enrolled users, then across the entire site. Only an exact, unique name match will be organised into the group; if multiple users share the same name, the record will be skipped and flagged for review.

To include students for enrolment, the following fields are required:

* Username - student number/ID
* Firstname - given name
* Lastname - surname
* Email - the student’s email address

If a student record already exists, they will simply be enrolled and grouped.

If a new account is required, a password is auto-generated and must be changed at first login.';
